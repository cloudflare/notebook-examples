# Cloudflare Radar

[Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com) is a hub that showcases global Internet traffic, attacks, and technology trends and insights. It is powered by data from Cloudflare’s global network, as well as aggregated and [anonymized](/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/) data from Cloudflare’s [1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver](/1.1.1.1/).

Radar's API is free, allowing academics, data sleuths and other web enthusiasts to investigate Internet usage across the globe.

Usage of the API and its data is made available under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) (i.e. non-commercial license).
